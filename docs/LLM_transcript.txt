Prompt 1: 

You are asked to implement a Python function that suggests possible meeting time slots for a given day. The function takes as input a list of existing calendar events for that day and a desired meeting duration. Its goal is to return a list of valid start times at which the meeting could be scheduled. A valid time slot should respect typical working hours and should not conflict with existing events. If no suitable time slots are available, the function should return an empty list. You may assume that time values are provided in a standard string format (e.g., “09:30”).

from typing import List, Dict

def suggest_slots(
    events: List[Dict[str, str]],
    meeting_duration: int,
    day: str
) -> List[str]:
    """
    Suggest possible meeting start times for a given day.

    Args:
        events: List of dicts with keys {"start": "HH:MM", "end": "HH:MM"}
        meeting_duration: Desired meeting length in minutes
        day: Three-letter day abbreviation (e.g., "Mon", "Tue", ... "Fri")

    Returns:
        List of valid start times as "HH:MM" sorted ascending
    """
    # TODO: Implement this function

finish implementing this function

LLM Response 1: 

Here’s a clean, reasonable implementation with clear assumptions baked in and documented.

**Assumptions (explicit and common-sense):**

* Working hours are **09:00–17:00**.
* Meetings can start on **minute boundaries** (e.g., every minute).
* Only **Mon–Fri** are working days; weekends return no slots.
* Events may be unsorted and may touch but not overlap (end == start is OK).

```python
from typing import List, Dict

def suggest_slots(
    events: List[Dict[str, str]],
    meeting_duration: int,
    day: str
) -> List[str]:
    """
    Suggest possible meeting start times for a given day.

    Args:
        events: List of dicts with keys {"start": "HH:MM", "end": "HH:MM"}
        meeting_duration: Desired meeting length in minutes
        day: Three-letter day abbreviation (e.g., "Mon", "Tue", ... "Fri")

    Returns:
        List of valid start times as "HH:MM" sorted ascending
    """

    # Only allow weekdays
    if day not in {"Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri"}:
        return []

    WORK_START = 9 * 60    # 09:00
    WORK_END = 17 * 60    # 17:00

    def to_minutes(t: str) -> int:
        h, m = map(int, t.split(":"))
        return h * 60 + m

    def to_time_str(minutes: int) -> str:
        return f"{minutes // 60:02d}:{minutes % 60:02d}"

    # Convert and sort events
    busy_intervals = sorted(
        [(to_minutes(e["start"]), to_minutes(e["end"])) for e in events],
        key=lambda x: x[0]
    )

    available_starts = []

    current_time = WORK_START

    for start, end in busy_intervals:
        # Check if there is free space before this event
        while current_time + meeting_duration <= min(start, WORK_END):
            available_starts.append(to_time_str(current_time))
            current_time += 1  # granularity: 1 minute

        # Move current_time forward if overlapping
        if current_time < end:
            current_time = max(current_time, end)

    # Check remaining time after last event
    while current_time + meeting_duration <= WORK_END:
        available_starts.append(to_time_str(current_time))
        current_time += 1

    return available_starts
```

If you want:

* 15-minute granularity instead of every minute
* configurable working hours
* or support for overlapping / invalid events

say the word and we’ll tweak it.
